## About the Project

This is my first ever major project cum case study in the field of data analytics. The case study all about helping an organization named Cyclistic to lure more casual riders to take annual membership. My role as a junior data analyst was to find the major differences between the two types of the riders and to get insights from the data and to help the marketing team to design an appropriate marketing campaign.
